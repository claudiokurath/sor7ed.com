🧠 Hyperfocus Survival Kit

Lost in the tunnel and forgot to eat/sleep/exist? Here's your complete hyperfocus management system.

---

**IF YOU'RE IN THE TUNNEL RIGHT NOW**

Get out in 5 minutes:
1. Stand up (breaks the physical state)
2. Leave the room (gets you out of environment)
3. Drink water (rehydrate)
4. Eat something (you forgot, didn't you?)
5. Move your body (walk, stretch, anything)

DO NOT "just finish this one thing" (you won't stop).

---

**EXIT PROTOCOLS (Get out before the crash)**

Set multiple alarms:
• Hour 2: "Stand up and stretch" (don't ignore this)
• Hour 4: "Eat something" (seriously, eat)
• Hour 6: "HARD STOP" (must leave room)

Best exit method: HUMAN INTERRUPT
Ask someone to call you at [time] and don't let you hang up until you stand up.

---

**RECOVERY CHECKLIST (Post-hyperfocus hangover)**

You just ran a mental marathon. Your brain is WRECKED.

Immediate (0-2 hours):
• Eat protein (brain recovery fuel)
• Drink 2+ glasses of water (you're dehydrated)
• Lie down if possible
• Do LOW-DEMAND activity (comfort show, easy game)

Avoid for 4+ hours:
✗ Big decisions (you're impaired)
✗ Difficult conversations (you're fragile)
✗ Starting another hyperfocus (back-to-back = crash)

---

**PARTNER COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS**

Before you start:
"Hey, I'm going into the tunnel for [X hours]. I'll be unreachable. I still love you. See you at [time]."

When they interrupt you:
"I'm in hyperfocus. Give me 15 minutes to finish this section, then I'm all yours."

After you emerge:
"Sorry if I was distant. That was hyperfocus, not you. Thank you for being patient."

# TRIGGER: WORKMELT
**POST:** Meltdowns at work

```
🚨 Workplace Meltdown Protocol

About to meltdown at work and need an exit plan?
Not a tantrum. Not weakness. A nervous system in crisis.

---

**IF YOU'RE MELTING DOWN RIGHT NOW**

Emergency exit (use immediately):

Step 1: Leave the area
• Bathroom (lock door)
• Outside (even 5 minutes)
• Quiet room
• Your car

Step 2: Ground your body
• Cold water on face + wrists
• Deep breaths: In 4, hold 4, out 6
• If you can, cry (releases cortisol)

Step 3: Text someone
"I'm melting down at work. I'm safe but need 15 minutes."

---

**DO NOT:**
✗ Try to power through (makes it worse)
✗ Apologize to coworkers yet (wait until calm)
✗ Make decisions (you're dysregulated)

---

**THE WORK P.A.R.K. PROTOCOL**

When you feel meltdown approaching:

P - Pause: Stop what you're doing.
A - Acknowledge: "I'm overstimulated. My nervous system is overwhelmed."
R - Retreat: Leave the environment.
K - Kindness: "This is my brain protecting me. I'm not broken, I'm overwhelmed."

---

**MANAGER COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES**

Immediate (when you need to leave):
"Hi [Manager], I need to step away for 15 minutes to manage sensory overload. I'll be back shortly and will catch up on anything I missed."

# TRIGGER: ALCOHOL
**POST:** Alcohol and your ADHD meds

```
🍺 Alcohol + ADHD Meds Harm-Reduction Checklist

Concerned about your drinking patterns? Here's the truth about mixing stimulants and alcohol.

---

**IF YOU'RE IN DANGER RIGHT NOW**

☎️ Get help if:
• You have withdrawal symptoms (shaking, sweating, seizures)
• You're drinking in the morning to "steady yourself"
• You've had blackouts

Call 999 or go to A&E immediately. Alcohol withdrawal can be FATAL.

---

**WHY THIS HAPPENS (Pharmacology):**

1. Stimulants mask alcohol's effects (you don't "feel" drunk)
2. You drink MORE because of this mask
3. Your liver processes both substances (overload)
4. When meds wear off, alcohol hits all at once (the crash)
5. Heart strain: stimulant + depressant = cardiovascular stress

---

**HARM REDUCTION (If not ready to quit):**

1. Time your meds differently: Don't drink until 4-6 hours after last dose.
2. Track your drinks: Use app like Less or Cutback Coach.
3. Replace the function:
   Need sedative effect? Try Magnesium, weighted blanket.
   Need sensory regulation? Try hot bath, intense exercise.
   Need social lubricant? Try alcohol-free beers.

---

**SAFER DRINKING PROTOCOL:**

• Eat a full meal first (slows absorption)
• Drink water (1 glass per alcoholic drink)
• Set a limit before you start (e.g., "2 drinks max")
• Tell someone your limit (accountability)

Tell your household:
"I lost my job. Here's what I need from you: [space/help with bills/body doubling for UC application]."

---

**HOUR 48-72: DAMAGE CONTROL**

Negotiate your exit:
• Can you resign instead of being fired? (Looks better)
• Request neutral reference in writing
• Get employment confirmation letter

This might be discrimination. Contact ACAS: 0300 123 1100

**SHAME INTERRUPTION:**

When the voice says: "You're unemployable."
Respond: "I've been fired because the structure didn't fit my brain. That's data, not failure. I'm building better systems."

# TRIGGER: DEBT
**POST:** The debt spiral

```
💳 Debt Triage Protocol (Shame-Free)

Drowning in debt and can't face the numbers? 
ADHD impulse spending isn't moral failure. It's dopamine regulation.

5. Everything else
